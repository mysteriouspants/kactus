I've made some modifications to this lovely theme, 314, which include:

*  Modified homepage, which doesn't include pagination by default, because who needs it? It now displays the year in which a post was made, which is ideal for intermittent bloggers.
*  Adds MathJax for $$\LaTeX$$ formatting of equations.
*  Comment sections give me cancer. So I removed Disqus completely.
*  Removes frustrating and distracting "social" buttons.

These modifications obviously reflect my opinions, which are that comment sections are silly, maths is awesome, and that pagination isn't necessarily a good thing.
